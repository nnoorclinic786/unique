 * # Firestore Security Rules: WholesaleRx App
 *
 * ## Core Philosophy
 * This ruleset implements a hybrid security model combining Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for administrators and a strict user-ownership model for buyers. The primary goal is to ensure that buyers can only access and manage their own data, while granting administrators the necessary privileges to manage the platform (e.g., approve buyer requests, manage the drug catalog) and view user data for support and fulfillment purposes.
 *
 * ## Data Structure
 * The data is organized into several top-level collections to segregate permissions effectively:
 * - `/roles_admin/{adminId}`: Manages admin roles using a Database-Based Access Control (DBAC) pattern. The existence of a document grants admin privileges. This collection is not client-writable.
 * - `/admins/{adminEmail}`: Stores detailed admin user profiles, including permissions. Writable only by other admins.
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores approved buyer profiles. Each buyer has full control over their own document.
 * - `/buyer_requests/{requestId}`: A dedicated collection that acts as a queue for new buyer signups awaiting admin approval. This structural segregation simplifies rules and directly addresses the app's approval workflow.
 * - `/drugs/{drugId}`: The master drug catalog, readable by all authenticated users but writable only by administrators.
 * - `/orders/{orderId}`: A top-level collection for all orders. This supports admin queries. Buyer access is restricted at the document level.
 *
 * ## Key Security Decisions
 * - **Admin Role Management**: Admin access is determined by checking for a document in `/roles_admin/{uid}`. This is a performant and secure method that avoids reliance on custom claims.
 * - **Strict User Scoping**: Buyer-specific data in `/users/{userId}` ensures rules can easily enforce that a user can only access their own document.
 * - **No User Listing**: Listing all documents in the `/users` collection is explicitly disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - **Approval Queue**: New buyer registrations are created in a separate `/buyer_requests` collection. This is a deliberate choice for security and performance, allowing admins to list and process requests without granting them broad write access to the main `/users` collection.
 * - **Destructive Operations**: Deleting user profiles is disallowed from the client side to prevent accidental data loss. Deleting orders and buyer requests is permitted for authorized roles.
